# RAG: Step-by-Step Implementation

This repository demonstrates a step-by-step implementation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, focused on providing feature-specific search results for electronic products such as iPads and watches. The implementation leverages OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model and Atlas Vector DB for efficient data retrieval and accurate query responses.

## Overview

The RAG model combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to create an enhanced system capable of delivering precise and context-aware responses. This repository is structured to guide you through each step of setting up and running a RAG model tailored for electronic product queries.
